C  is a quirky, flowed, and an  enormous  success.  Although
accidents of history surely helped, it eveidently  satisfied
a need for a system implementation language efficient enough
to displace assembly language. yet sufficiently abstract and
fluent to describe algorithms and  interactions  in  a  wide
variety of environments. -- Dennis M. Ritchie
